# My DNA
When I die, you can recreate me with this.

This is my raw genetic data from 23andMe: [genome.txt](https://github.com/steveswinsburg/dna/master/blob/genome.txt)

Fields are TAB-separated. Each line corresponds to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). For each SNP, the following are provided:
* an identifier (an rsid or an internal id)
* its location on the reference human genome
* the genotype call oriented with respect to the plus strand on the human reference sequence.

This data uses reference human assembly build 37 (also known as Annotation Release 104). See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/map_search.cgi?taxid=9606
